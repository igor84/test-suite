This is a test suite to check GIF decoders.

To use read the file TESTS to find the list of tests.

For each test, open the file <name>.conf which will describe the test.

```ini
[config]
input = foo.gif          # Name of GIF file to decode
version = GIF89a         # GIF version
width = 16               # Expected width in pixels
height = 16              # Expected height in pixels
background = #ffffff     # Background color of image (ignored in most renderers, provided images use transparency for background)
frames = frame0,frame1   # Frames generated by this GIF
loop-count = 0           # Number of times to loop the animation or infinite to loop forever
force-animation = no     # If yes, then this is a GIF that is wrongly encoded but most readers interpret it as animated (a default delay is added to each image)
buffer-size = 0          # Number of bytes to buffer before playing (if present)
comment = 'Hello World'  # Comment extension set in file (if present)
color-profiles = foo.icc # ICC Color profiles (if present)
xmp-data = foo.xml       # Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) Data (if present)

[frame0]
image = foo0.png         # Expected frame in PNG format
delay = 5                # Expected delay after this frame in 1/100 ms

[frame1]
pixels = foo1.rgba       # Expected pixel data in 8 bit RGBA format
```
